I am a man. I am self aware.
Everywhere I go, you're always right there with me.
I flirted with you all my life
Even kissed you once or twice
To this day I swear it was nice.
But clearly, I was not ready.
When you touched a friend of mine, I thought I would loose my mind.
But I found out with time,
That really, i was not ready.
No, No
Oh death, oh death, oh death.
Really, I'm not ready.
Of death you hinder me.
Death makes those dear to me.
Tease me with your sweet relief.
You're cool, and you are constant.
When my mom was cancer sick,
She fought but then succumb to it.
But you made her beg for it,
Lord Jesus, please, I'm ready.
Oh death, oh death, oh death.
Really I'm not ready.
No no.
Oh death, oh death, oh death.
Clearly I'm not ready.
